Once upon a time in a <adjective> land, there lived a <noun>. This <noun> had a peculiar habit of <verb-ing> every <time_unit>. One day, a <adjective> <noun> approached and asked, "Why do you always <verb>?"

The <noun> replied, "<exclamation>! It brings me <emotion> and makes the <noun_plural> happy." The <adjective> <noun> nodded in understanding and decided to join in the <verb-ing> fun.

From that day forward, the <adjective> land became a <adjective> and <adjective> place, filled with laughter and <noun_plural>. And they all <verb-ed> happily ever after.

The end.
